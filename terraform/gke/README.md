## Overview

This directory contains Terraform configuration files to quickly set up the
infrastructure for your Autoscaler for a deployment to
[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)][gke].

This deployment is ideal for independent teams who want to self-manage the
infrastructure and configuration of their own Autoscalers on Kubernetes.

## Architecture

![architecture-gke-unified][architecture-gke-unified]

1.  Using a [Kubernetes ConfigMap][kubernetes-configmap] you define which
    Memorystore Cluster instances you would like to be managed by
    the autoscaler.

2.  Using a [Kubernetes CronJob][kubernetes-cronjob], the autoscaler is
    configured to run on a schedule. By default this is every two minutes,
    though this is configurable.

3.  When scheduled, an instance of the [Poller][autoscaler-poller]
    is created as a [Kubernetes Job][kubernetes-job].

4.  The Poller queries the [Cloud Monitoring][cloud-monitoring] API to retrieve
    the utilization metrics for each Memorystore Cluster instance.

5.  For each Spanner instance, the Poller makes a call to the Scaler via its
    API. The request payload contains the utilization metrics for the specific
    Memorystore Cluster instance, and some of its corresponding
    configuration parameters.

6.  Using the chosen [scaling method][scaling-methods] the Scaler compares
    the Memorystore Cluster instance metrics against the recommended
    thresholds, plus or minus an [allowed margin][margins] and determines
    if the instance should be scaled, and the number of shards/nodes that it
    should be scaled to.

7.  The Scaler retrieves the time when the instance was last scaled from the
    state data stored in [Cloud Firestore][cloud-firestore] (or alternatively
    [Spanner][spanner]) and compares it with the current time.

8.  If the configured cooldown period has passed, then the Scaler requests the
    Memorystore Cluster instance to scale out or in.

9.  Autoscaler components publish counters to an [OpenTelemetry Collector][otel-collector],
    also running in Kubernetes, which is configured to forward these counters to
    [Google Cloud Monitoring][gcm-docs]. See section
    [Metrics in GKE deployment](#metrics-in-gke-deployment)

The GKE deployment has the following pros and cons:

### Pros

*   **Kubernetes-based**: For teams that may not be able to use Google Cloud
    services such as [Cloud Run functions][cloud-functions], this design enables
    the use of the Autoscaler.
*   **Configuration**: The control over scheduler parameters belongs to the team
    that owns the Memorystore Cluster instance, therefore the team has the
    highest degree of freedom to adapt the Autoscaler to its needs.
*   **Infrastructure**: This design establishes a clear boundary of
    responsibility and security over the Autoscaler infrastructure because the
    Autoscaler infrastructure.

### Cons

*   **Infrastructure**: In contrast to the [Cloud Run functions][cloud-functions]
    design, some long-lived infrastructure and services are required.
*   **Maintenance**: with each team being responsible for the Autoscaler
    configuration and infrastructure it may become difficult to make sure that
    all Autoscalers across the company follow the same update guidelines.
*   **Audit**: because of the high level of control by each team, a centralized
    audit may become more complex.

The Poller and Scaler components are be deployed as a single pod, which runs
as a Kubernetes cron job. This means there are no long-running components.

## Before you begin

In this section you prepare your environment.

1.  Open the [Cloud Console][cloud-console]
2.  Activate [Cloud Shell][cloud-shell] \
    At the bottom of the Cloud Console, a [Cloud Shell][cloud-shell]
    session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell
    environment with the Cloud SDK already installed, including the
    <code>gcloud</code> command-line tool, and with values already set for your
    current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.

3.  In Cloud Shell, clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/memorystore-cluster-autoscaler.git
    ```

4.  Change into the directory of the cloned repository, and check out the
    `main` branch:

    ```sh
    cd memorystore-cluster-autoscaler && git checkout main
    ```

5.  Export a variable for the Autoscaler working directory:

    ```sh
    export AUTOSCALER_ROOT="$(pwd)"
    ```

## Preparing the Autoscaler Project

In this section you prepare your project for deployment.

1.  Go to the [project selector page][project-selector] in the Cloud Console.
    Select or create a Cloud project.

2.  Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
    [Learn how to confirm billing is enabled for your project][enable-billing].

3.  In Cloud Shell, configure the environment with the ID of your
    **autoscaler** project:

    ```sh
    export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
    ```

4.  Set the region where the Autoscaler resources will be created:

    ```sh
    export REGION=us-central1
    ```

5.  Enable the required Cloud APIs:

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable \
      artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
      cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
      cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
      compute.googleapis.com \
      container.googleapis.com \
      iam.googleapis.com \
      memorystore.googleapis.com \
      networkconnectivity.googleapis.com \
      pubsub.googleapis.com \
      logging.googleapis.com \
      monitoring.googleapis.com \
      redis.googleapis.com \
      serviceconsumermanagement.googleapis.com
    ```

6.  The Autoscaler is capable of scaling two types of Memorystore clusters:

    1.  [Memorystore for Redis Cluster][memorystore-for-redis-cluster]
    2.  [Memorystore for Valkey][memorystore-for-valkey]

    [Memorystore for Redis Cluster][memorystore-for-redis-cluster] is the default.

    If you would like to use [Memorystore for Valkey][memorystore-for-valkey], set
    the following variable:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_memorystore_engine=VALKEY
    ```

7.  There are two options for deploying the state store for the Autoscaler:

    1.  Store the state in [Firestore][cloud-firestore]
    2.  Store the state in [Spanner][spanner]

    For Firestore, follow the steps in
    [Using Firestore for Autoscaler State](#using-firestore-for-autoscaler-state).
    For Spanner, follow the steps in [Using Spanner for Autoscaler state](#using-spanner-for-autoscaler-state).

### Using Firestore for Autoscaler state

1.  To use Firestore for the Autoscaler state, enable the additional API:

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com
    ```

2.  If you want to choose the name for your Firestore database, set the
    following variable:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_firestore_state_database=<DATABASE_NAME>
    ```

    If you do not set this variable, Terraform will create and use a dedicated
    Firestore database named `memorystore-autoscaler-state` for storing
    Autoscaler state.

    You will also need to make a minor modification to the Autoscaler
    configuration. The required steps to do this are later in these
    instructions.

3.  Next, continue to [Creating Autoscaler infrastructure](#creating-autoscaler-infrastructure).

### Using Spanner for Autoscaler state

1.  To use Spanner for the Autoscaler state, enable the additional API:

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable spanner.googleapis.com
    ```

2.  If you want Terraform to create a Spanner instance (named
    `memorystore-autoscaler-state` by default) to store the state,
    set the following variable:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_terraform_spanner_state=true
    ```

    If you already have a Spanner instance where state must be stored,
    set the the name of your instance:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_spanner_state_name=<SPANNER_INSTANCE_NAME>
    ```

    If you want to manage the state of the Autoscaler in your own
    Cloud Spanner instance, please create the following table in advance:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE memorystoreClusterAutoscaler (
      id STRING(MAX),
      lastScalingTimestamp TIMESTAMP,
      createdOn TIMESTAMP,
      updatedOn TIMESTAMP,
      lastScalingCompleteTimestamp TIMESTAMP,
      scalingOperationId STRING(MAX),
      scalingRequestedSize INT64,
      scalingPreviousSize INT64,
      scalingMethod STRING(MAX),
    ) PRIMARY KEY (id)
    ```

3.  Next, continue to [Creating Autoscaler infrastructure](#creating-autoscaler-infrastructure).

## Creating Autoscaler infrastructure

In this section you deploy the Autoscaler infrastructure.

1.  Set the project ID and region in the corresponding Terraform
    environment variables:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_project_id=${PROJECT_ID}
    export TF_VAR_region=${REGION}
    ```

2.  By default, a new Memorystore Cluster instance will be created for testing.
    If you want to scale an existing Memorystore Cluster instance, set the
    following variable:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_terraform_memorystore_cluster=false
    ```

    Set the following variable to choose the name of a new or existing cluster
    to scale:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_memorystore_cluster_name=<memorystore-cluster-name>
    ```

    If you do not set this variable, `autoscaler-target-memorystore-cluster`
    will be used.

    For more information on how to configure your cluster to be managed by
    Terraform, see [Importing your Memorystore Cluster instances](#importing-your-memorystore-cluster-instances).

3.  To create a testbench VM with utilities for testing Memorystore, including
    generating load, set the following variable:

    ```sh
    export TF_VAR_terraform_test_vm=true
    ```

    Note that this option can only be selected when you have chosen to create a
    new Memorystore cluster.

4.  Change directory into the Terraform directory and initialize it:

    ```sh
    cd "${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/terraform/gke/unified"
    terraform init
    ```

5.  Create the Autoscaler infrastructure. Answer `yes` when prompted, after
    reviewing the resources that Terraform intends to create.

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

If you are running this command in Cloud Shell and encounter errors of the form
"`Error: cannot assign requested address`", this is a
[known issue][provider-issue] in the Terraform Google provider, please retry
with `-parallelism=1`.

## Building the Autoscaler

1.  Change to the directory that contains the Autoscaler source code:

    ```sh
    cd ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}
    ```

2.  Build the Autoscaler:

    ```sh
    gcloud beta builds submit . --config=cloudbuild-unified.yaml --region=${REGION} --service-account="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/build-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

3.  Construct the path to the image:

    ```sh
    SCALER_PATH="${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/memorystore-cluster-autoscaler/scaler"
    ```

4.  Retrieve the SHA256 hash of the image:

    ```sh
    SCALER_SHA=$(gcloud artifacts docker images describe ${SCALER_PATH}:latest --format='value(image_summary.digest)')
    ```

5.  Construct the full path to the image, including the SHA256 hash:

    ```sh
    SCALER_IMAGE="${SCALER_PATH}@${SCALER_SHA}"
    ```

## Deploying the Autoscaler

1.  Retrieve the credentials for the cluster where the Autoscaler will be deployed:

    ```sh
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials memorystore-cluster-autoscaler --region=${REGION}
    ```

2.  Prepare the Autoscaler YAML configuration files from their templates by
    running the following command:

    ```sh
    cd ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/kubernetes/unified && \
    for template in $(ls autoscaler-config/*.template) ; do envsubst < ${template} > ${template%.*} ; done
    ```

3.  Deploy the `otel-collector` service so that it is ready to collect metrics:

    ```sh
    cd ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/kubernetes/unified && \
    kubectl apply -f autoscaler-config/otel-collector.yaml && \
    kubectl apply -f autoscaler-pkg/networkpolicy.yaml && \
    kubectl apply -f autoscaler-pkg/otel-collector/otel-collector.yaml
    ```

4.  Next configure the Kubernetes manifests and deploy the Autoscaler to
    the cluster using the following commands:

    ```sh
    cd ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/kubernetes/unified && \
    kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/apply-setters:v0.1.1 autoscaler-pkg -- \
       scaler_image=${SCALER_IMAGE} && kubectl apply -f autoscaler-pkg/ --recursive
    ```

5.  Next, to see how the Autoscaler is configured, run the following command to
    output the example configuration:

    ```sh
    cat autoscaler-config/autoscaler-config.yaml
    ```

    This file configures the instance of the autoscaler that you
    scheduled in the previous step.

    You can autoscale multiple Spanner instances on a single schedule by
    including multiple YAML stanzas in any of the scheduled configurations. For
    the schema of the configuration, see the
    [Poller configuration][autoscaler-config-params] section.

6.  If you have chosen to use Firestore to hold the Autoscaler state as described
    above, edit the above file, and remove the following lines:

    ```yaml
     stateDatabase:
       name: spanner
       instanceId: memorystore-autoscaler-state
       databaseId: memorystore-autoscaler-state
    ```

    **Note:** If you do not remove these lines, the Autoscaler will attempt to
    use the above non-existent Spanner database for its state store, which will
    result in errors. Please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
    section for more details.

    If you have chosen to use your own Spanner instance, please edit the above
    configuration file accordingly.

7.  To configure the Autoscaler and begin scaling operations, run the following
     command:

     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f autoscaler-config/
     ```

8.  Any changes made to the configuration files and applied with `kubectl
     apply` will update the Autoscaler configuration.

9.  You can view logs for the Autoscaler components via `kubectl` or the [Cloud
     Logging][cloud-console-logging] interface in the Google Cloud console.

## Connecting to the Test VM

To connect to the optionally created test VM, run the following command:

```sh
function memorystore-testbench-ssh {
  export TEST_VM_NAME=$(terraform output -raw test_vm_name)
  export TEST_VM_ZONE=$(terraform output -raw test_vm_zone)
  export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
  gcloud compute ssh --zone "${TEST_VM_ZONE}" "${TEST_VM_NAME}" --tunnel-through-iap --project "${PROJECT_ID}"
}
```

## Configuration

After deploying the Autoscaler, you can configure its parameters by
editing the [Kubernetes ConfigMap][kubernetes-configmap].

The configuration is defined as a YAML array. Each element in the array
represents a Memorystore Cluster instance that will managed by the Autoscaler
cron job that specifies this ConfigMap.

You can create multiple autoscaler cron jobs specifying different ConfigMaps.
This is useful for example if you want to have an instance configured with the
linear method for normal operations, but also have another Autoscaler
configuration with the direct method for planned batch workloads.

You can find the details about the configuration parameters and their default
values in the [Poller component page][autoscaler-configuration].

Modifying the ConfigMap can either be done by editing it in the Cloud Console,
or by modifying the YAML source file and applying the changes using the
`kubectl` tool:

### Using Cloud Console

1.  Open the
    [Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/config)
    in the Cloud Console.

2.  Select the `autoscaler-config` Config Map.

3.  Click **Edit** on the top bar.

4.  The configuration is stored in the `data/autoscaler-config.yaml` literal
    block scaler value as a YAML array.

    Each element in the array represents the configuration parameters for a
    Memorystore Cluster instance that will be managed by the Kubernetes cron job
    referencing this ConfigMap.

5.  Modify the configuration and click **Save**

    The ConfigMap is updated and the new configuration will be used next time the
    job runs.

### Using the ConfigMap definition file

1.  Go to the directory specifying the Autoscaler Kubernetes configuration:

    ```shell
    cd ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/kubernetes/unified
    ```

2.  Edit the file `autoscaler-config/autoscaler-config.yaml`

3.  The configuration is stored in the `data/autoscaler-config.yaml` literal
    block scaler value as a YAML array.

    Each element in the array represents a Memorystore Cluster instance that will
    be managed by the Kubernetes cron job referencing this ConfigMap.

4.  Modify and save this file.

5.  Apply the changes to the ConfigMap using the command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f autoscaler-config/autoscaler-config.yaml
    ```

    The ConfigMap is updated and the configuration will be used next time the
    job runs.

## Metrics in GKE deployment

Unlike in a Cloud Run functions deployment, in a GKE deployment, the counters
generated by the `poller` and `scaler` components are forwarded to the
[OpenTelemetry Collector (`otel-collector`)][otel-collector] service.
This service is specified by an the environmental variable `OTEL_COLLECTOR_URL`
passed to the poller and scaler workloads.

This collector is run as a [service](../../kubernetes/unified/autoscaler-pkg/otel-collector/otel-collector.yaml)
to receive metrics as gRPC messages on port 4317, then export them to Google
Cloud Monitoring. This configuration is defined in a
[ConfigMap](../../kubernetes/unified/autoscaler-config/otel-collector.yaml.template).

Metrics can be sent to other exporters by modifying the Collector ConfigMap.

A [NetworkPolicy rule](../../kubernetes/unified/autoscaler-pkg/networkpolicy.yaml)
is also configured to allow traffic from the Autoscaler workloads
(labelled with `otel-submitter:true`) to the `otel-collector` service.

If the environment variable `OTEL_COLLECTOR_URL` is not specified, the metrics
will be sent directly to Google Cloud Monitoring.

To allow Google Cloud Monitoring to distinguish metrics from different instances
of the Autosaler components, the Kubernetes Pod name is passed to the poller and
scaler componnents via the environmental variable `K8S_POD_NAME`. If this
variable is not specified, and if the Pod name attribute is not appended to the
metrics by configuring the
[Kubernetes Attributes Processor](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/collector/components/#kubernetes-attributes-processor)
in the OpenTelemetry Collector, then there will be Send TimeSeries errors
reported when the Collector exports the metrics to Gogole Cloud Monitoring.

## Importing your Memorystore Cluster instances

If you have existing Memorystore Cluster instances that you want to
[import to be managed by Terraform][terraform-import], follow the instructions
in this section.

1.  List your Memorystore clusters:

    ```sh
    gcloud redis clusters list --format="table(name)"
    ```

2.  Set the following variable with the instance name from the output of the
    above command that you want to import

    ```sh
    MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME=<YOUR_MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME>
    ```

3.  Create a Terraform config file with an empty
    [`google_redis_cluster`][terraform-redis-cluster] resource:

    ```sh
    echo "resource \"google_redis_cluster\" \"${MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME}\" {}" > "${MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME}.tf"
    ```

4.  [Import][terraform-import-usage] the Memorystore Cluster instance into the Terraform
    state.

    ```sh
    terraform import "google_redis_cluster.${MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME}" "${MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME}"
    ```

5.  After the import succeeds, update the Terraform config file for your
    instance with the actual instance attributes

    ```sh
    # TODO fields to exclude
    terraform state show -no-color "google_redis_cluster.${MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME}" \
      | grep -vE "(id|state).*(=|\{)" \
      > "${MEMORYSTORE_CLUSTER_NAME}.tf"
    ```

If you have additional Memorystore clusters to import, repeat this process.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains guidance on what to do if you encounter issues when
following the instructions above.

### If the GKE cluster is not successfully created

1.  Check there are no [Organizational Policy][organizational-policy] rules
    that may conflict with cluster creation.

### If you do not see scaling operations as expected

1.  The first step if you are encountering scaling issues is to check the logs
    for the Autoscaler in [Cloud Logging][cloud-console-logging]. To retrieve
    the logs for the Autoscaler components, use the following query:

    ```terminal
    resource.type="k8s_container"
    resource.labels.namespace_name="memorystore-cluster-autoscaler"
    resource.labels.container_name="scaler"
    ```

    If you do not see any log entries, check that you have selected the correct
    time period to display in the Cloud Logging console, and that the GKE
    cluster nodes have the correct permissions to write logs to the Cloud
    Logging API ([roles/logging.logWriter][logging-iam-role]).

### If the Poller fails to run successfully

1.  If you have chosen to use Firestore for Autoscaler state and you see the
    following error in the logs:

    ```sh
     Error: 5 NOT_FOUND: Database not found: projects/<YOUR_PROJECT>/instances/memorystore-autoscaler-state/databases/memorystore-autoscaler-state
    ```

    Edit the file `${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/autoscaler-config/autoscaler-config.yaml`
    and remove the following stanza:

    ```yaml
     stateDatabase:
       name: spanner
       instanceId: memorystore-autoscaler-state
       databaseId: memorystore-autoscaler-state
    ```

2.  Check the formatting of the YAML configration file:

    ```sh
    cat ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/autoscaler-config/autoscaler-config.yaml
    ```

3.  Validate the contents of the YAML configuraration file:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run validate-config-file -- ${AUTOSCALER_ROOT}/autoscaler-config/autoscaler-config.yaml
    ```
